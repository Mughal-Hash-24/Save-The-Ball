# Save-The-Ball
A 2d game inspired by Chrome Dino game created in pygame and python. Instead of a Dino you control a Ball and bounce it and stop it from being blown up by the mystical thorns. A vibrant color scheme encapsulates the player in playing continuously.

## üß† Inspiration

Inspired by the **Chrome Dino Game**, this version introduces a fresh concept:  
- The **ball** as the central character  
- **Mystical thorns** as threats  
- A **more colorful**, arcade-inspired environment that breaks away from the desert grayscale of the original
